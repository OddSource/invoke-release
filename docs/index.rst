**Invoke Release** is a set of command line tools that help software engineers release Python projects quickly, easily,
and in a consistent manner. It helps ensure that the version standards for your projects are the same across all of
your organization's projects, and minimizes the possible errors that can occur during a release. It uses Git for
committing release changes and creating release tags for your project.

Built atop the popular open source Python tool `Invoke <http://www.pyinvoke.org/>`_, Invoke Release exists as a
collection of standard Invoke tasks that you can easily include in all of your projects with just a few lines of Python
code per project.
